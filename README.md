# Credit card fraud detection
 Credit card fraudulent transactions poses significant threat of financial loses to customer and Banks as banks may lose their high value customers due to this. Objective of this work is “To build machine learning models for detecting credit card fraudulent transactions based on the parameters available”.

## Problem statement:
A data set have been provided which has the credit card transactions made by European cardholders over a period of two days in September 2013. In the given transactions, 492 out of 2,84,807 transactions are fraudulent which is 0.172% of the total transactions. The data set provided has been modified using PCA except time, amount and class variable. We have to build a model to predict a possible fraud transaction based on the parameters provided. There are total 30 feature given in the dataset and one target variable ‘Class’ (which represents class labelling, and it takes the value 1 in cases of fraud and 0 in others). There is significant class imbalance in the dataset which is to be taken care while building the model.
